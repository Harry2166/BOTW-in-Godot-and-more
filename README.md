# 3d-godot-game

Going to be the first game I've made in a while. Will be making a 3d game, idk what genre, might start off with a 3d platformer since that's what the tutorials I'm searching for are teaching, but might branch off to something like Zelda.

Will first be following BornCG's 3d Platformer Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TTp8Ng3C57spnNkOw3Hm_35
