Initially followed: BornCG's 3d Platformer Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TTp8Ng3C57spnNkOw3Hm_35

## Motivation
Playing through BOTW again made me want to recreate the features of the game.

## Abilities
The runes from BOTW's basic functionality have been recreated in Godot. Other additional abilities were added.
  1. A magnetic field that you can control polarity.
  2. An ultrahand / magnesis-esque ability that allows you to control objects and bring them where you want.
  3. Stasis, which is like in BOTW, wherein you can stop an object.
  4. Bomb, which places a bomb in front of you which allows you to pick it up and blow it up
  5. Cryonis, which is like in BOTW, wherein you can create and destroy ice blocks on water.

## Controls
Currently, only controllers are supported and there are no keyboard and mouse support.

## Features TBA
1. Proper momentum tracking for stasis
2. Paragliding
3. Stamina Bar
